### prompt sample
+ https://makesprite.com
```sh 
A wide sprite sheet featuring various isometric cyberpunk-themed buildings on a pure white background. The buildings include a gritty futuristic skyscraper with neon signs, a high-tech bar with holographic advertisements, a rundown apartment complex with visible wires and pipes, a cybernetic repair shop with glowing accents, and a futuristic convenience store with a vibrant storefront. Each building is depicted with a slight 3/4 top-down perspective, maintaining the isometric style. The style should be inspired by cyberpunk aesthetics with a mix of dark tones and bright neon colors.
