  ```sh 
  [Lottie React Native] Using install_modules_dependencies
  [!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "hermes-engine":
    In snapshot (Podfile.lock):
      hermes-engine (from `../node_modules/react-native/sdks/hermes-engine/hermes-engine.podspec`)

    In Podfile:
      hermes-engine (from `../node_modules/react-native/sdks/hermes-engine/hermes-engine.podspec`)

  It seems like you've changed the version of the dependency `hermes-engine` and it differs from the version stored in `Pods/Local Podspecs`.
  You should run `pod update hermes-engine --no-repo-update` to apply changes made locally.
  ```
  - 설명대로 해도 안되서ㅓ `Podfile.lock` 지우고 재시도
  ```sh 
  [!] The following Swift pods cannot yet be integrated as static libraries:

  The Swift pod `GTMAppAuth` depends upon `GTMSessionFetcher` and `AppAuth`, which do not define modules. To opt into those targets generating module maps (which is necessary to import them from Swift when building as static libraries), you may set `use_modular_headers!` globally in your Podfile, or specify `:modular_headers => true` for particular dependencies.

  - `Podfile.lock` 을 지우면 모든게 업데이트되면서 더 꼬임
  - `Podfile`에서 설정한 `$FirebaseSDKVersion = '10.23.0'` 에 마자춰서 수동으로 `Podfile.lock` 내부에서 버전 수정
